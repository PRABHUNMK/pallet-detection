# pallet-detection using computer vision.

This project implements pallet detection using YOLOv5, OpenCV, and PyTorch. It allows for the efficient detection of pallets in images and video streams.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
PyTorch
OpenCV
YOLOv5 pretrained weights (provide download link)
CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)
